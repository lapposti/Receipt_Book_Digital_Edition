Explanation of Metadata
The “Receipt Book” is a collection of recipes dating back to the 1700s.  “The Recipes Project” includes the work of Sara 
Pennell who is a historian that has focused on food culture during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. I interpreted 
her perspective as one that emphasizes the kitchen as a historical place, so in approaching my metadata I wanted to 
understand what the recipes can provide as context for what was going on in England during the time period. The first
column is the individual file name so that I would be able to orientate myself as I gathered the rest of the information. For 
The second column I gave each file a Unique ID which consisted of “MS2096” followed by its corresponding number. This 
reflected the Ms. Codex which is also the third column. This helps identify the source and shelf mark within the centers catalogue. 
The physical book had different page numbers than what the library assigned to it so I thought the page orientation would be important
so that I would be able to understand the correlation between recipes if they went over the page. R stands for recto, right side of the page
and V stands for verso, left or backside of the page. The page numbers correlate to those assigned by the library. The recipe category is 
how I categorized the food that was mentioned in the recipe. This category I kept broad and without correlation for example between
“fruit” and “breakfast”. Since I only referred to tittles and not the actual recipe breakdown, I can further expand this category.  For key 
ingredients, I focused on what ingredient was mentioned in the title and for the last category, preparation method/form I listed what was
actually being done with the ingredient. I think these processes work together to explain the context and give a story about the person 
creating these dishes and what their intentions were in doing so. For the last four pages, since they are cover pages, the information 
wasn’t applicable but they tell their own stories as well. I included them because of the names, colors, and features that I think are 
important to my understanding of the book overall.
